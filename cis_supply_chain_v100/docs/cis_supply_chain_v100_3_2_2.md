## Description

Automatically scan every package for vulnerabilities.

## Rationale

Automatic scanning for vulnerabilities detects known vulnerabilities in packages and dependencies in use, allowing faster patching when one is found. Such vulnerabilities can lead to a massive breach if not handled as fast as possible, as attackers will also know about those vulnerabilities and swiftly try to take advantage of them. Scanning packages regularly for vulnerabilities can also verify usage compliance with the organizationâ€™s security policy.

## Audit

Ensure automatic scanning of packages for vulnerabilities is enabled.

## Remediation

Set automatic scanning of packages for vulnerabilities.
