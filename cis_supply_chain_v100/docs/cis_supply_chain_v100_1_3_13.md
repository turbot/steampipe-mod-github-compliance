## Description

Track code anomalies.

## Rationale

Carefully analyze any code anomalies within the organization. For example, a code anomaly could be a push made outside of working hours. Such a code push has a higher likelihood of being the result of an attack, as most if not all members of the organization would likely be outside the office. Another example is an activity that exceeds the average activity of a particular user. Tracking and auditing such behaviors creates additional layers of security and can aid in early detection of potential attacks.

## Audit

For every repository in use, ensure code anomalies relevant to the organization are promptly investigated.

## Remediation

For every repository in use, track and investigate anomalous code behavior and activity.
