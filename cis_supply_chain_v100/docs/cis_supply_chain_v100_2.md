## Overview

This section consists of security recommendations for the management of application build pipelines developed by an organization.

Build pipelines are a set of instructions dedicated to taking raw files of source code and running a series of tasks on them to achieve some final artifact as output. This artifact represents the final form of the recent version of software, which is subsequently packaged for convenient storing, handling, and deploying. Build pipelines are a general name for the environment in which this compilation process takes place, the pipeline files that orchestrate the process, and all sets of instructions related to them.
