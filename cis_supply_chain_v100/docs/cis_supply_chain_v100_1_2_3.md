## Description

Ensure only a limited number of trusted users can delete repositories.

## Rationale

Restricting the ability to delete repositories protects the organization from intentional and unintentional data loss. This ensures that users cannot delete repositories or cause other potential damage—whether by accident or due to their account being hacked—unless they have the correct privileges.

**Note**: Certain users will not be permitted to delete repositories.

## Audit

Verify that only a limited number of trusted users can delete repositories.

## Remediation

Enforce repository deletion by a few trusted and responsible users only.
