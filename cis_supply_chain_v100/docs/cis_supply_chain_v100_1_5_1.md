## Description

Detect and prevent sensitive data in code, such as confidential ID numbers, passwords, etc.

## Rationale

Having sensitive data in the source code makes it easier for attackers to maliciously use such information. In order to avoid this, designate scanners to identify and prevent the existence of sensitive data in the code.

## Audit

For every repository in use, verify that scanners are set to identify and prevent the existence of sensitive data in code.

## Remediation

For every repository in use, designate scanners to identify and prevent sensitive data in code.
