## Description

Enforce a policy for dependency usage across the organization. For example, disallow the use of packages less than 60 days old.

## Rationale

Enforcing a policy for dependency usage in an organization helps to manage dependencies across the organization and ensure that all usage is compliant with security policy. If, for example, the policy limits the package managers that can be used, enforcing it will make sure that every dependency is installed only from these package managers, and limit the risk of installing from any untrusted source.

## Audit

Verify that a policy for dependency usage is enforced across the organization.

## Remediation

Enforce policies for dependency usage across the organization.
