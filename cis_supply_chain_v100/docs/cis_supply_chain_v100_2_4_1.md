## Description

Sign all artifacts in all releases with user or organization keys.

## Rationale

Signing artifacts is used to validate both their integrity and security. Organizations signal that artifacts may be trusted and they themselves produced them by ensuring that every artifact is properly signed. The presence of this signature also makes potentially malicious activity far more difficult.

## Audit

Ensure every artifact in every release is signed.

## Remediation

For every artifact in every release, verify that all are properly signed.
