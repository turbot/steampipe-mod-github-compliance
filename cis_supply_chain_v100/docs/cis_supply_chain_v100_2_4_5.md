## Description

An SBOM is a file that specifies each component of software or a build process. Generate an SBOM after each run of a pipeline.

## Rationale

Generating an SBOM after each run of a pipeline will validate the integrity and security of that pipeline. Recording every step or component role in the pipeline ensures that no malicious acts have been committed during the pipelineâ€™s run.

## Audit

For each pipeline, ensure it produces an SBOM on every run.

## Remediation

For each pipeline, configure it to produce an SBOM on every run.
