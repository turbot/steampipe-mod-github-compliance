## Description

A workerâ€™s environment can be passed (for example, a pod in a Kubernetes cluster in which an environment variable is passed to it). It also can be pulled, like a virtual machine that is installing a package. Ensure that the environment and commands are passed to the workers and not pulled from it.

## Rationale

Passing an environment means additional configuration happens in the build time phase and not in run time. It will also pass locally and not remotely. Passing a worker environment, instead of pulling it from an outer source, reduces the possibility for an attacker to gain access and potentially pull malicious code into it. By passing locally and not pulling from remote, there is also less chance of an attack based on the remote connection, such as a man-in-the-middle or malicious scripts that can run from remote. This therefore prevents possible infection of the build worker.

## Audit

For each build worker, ensure its environment and commands are passed and not pulled.

## Remediation

For each build worker, pass its environment and commands to it instead of pulling it.
