## Description

Detect open-source license problems in used dependencies and fix them.

## Rationale

A software license is a legal document that establishes several key conditions between a software company or developer and a user in order to allow the use of software. Software licenses have the potential to create code dependencies. Not following the conditions in the software license can also lead to lawsuits. When using packages with a software license, especially commercial ones (which are the most permissive), it is important to verify what is allowed by that license in order to be protected against lawsuits.

## Audit

For every package in use, ensure scanners are set to identify open-source license problems.

## Remediation

For every package in use, designate scanners to identify open-source license problems and fix them.
