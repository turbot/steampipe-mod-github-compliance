## Description

Automate deployments of production environment and application.

## Rationale

Automating the deployments of both production environment and application reduces the risk for human mistakes—such as a wrong configuration or exposure of sensitive data—because it requires less human interaction or intervention. It also eases redeployment of the environment. It is best to automate with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) because it offers more control over changes made to the environment creation configuration and stores to a version control platform.

## Audit

For each deployment process, ensure it is automated.

## Remediation

Automate each deployment process of the production environment and application.
