## Overview

This section consists of security recommendations for the build pipelines environment.

Build environment is everything related to the infrastructure of the organization’s artifacts build—the orchestrator, the pipeline executer, where the build workers are running—while pipeline is a set of commands that runs in the build environment. Most of the build environment recommendations are relevant for self-hosted build platforms only, such as a CircleCI that is self-hosted.
