## Description

Restrict the organizationâ€™s Source Code Management (SCM) email notifications to approved domains only.

## Rationale

Restricting Source Code Management email notifications to verified domains only prevents data leaks, as personal emails and custom domains are more prone to account takeover via DNS hijacking or password breach.

*Note* Only members with approved email would be able to receive Source Code Management notifications.

## Audit

Ensure Source Code Management email notifications are restricted to approved domains only.

## Remediation

Restrict Source Code Management email notifications to approved domains only.
