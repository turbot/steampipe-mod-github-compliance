## Description

Keep build logs of the build environment detailing configuration and all activity within it. Also, consider storing them in a centralized organizational log store.

## Rationale

Logging the environment is important for two primary reasons: one, for debugging and investigating the environment in case of a bug or security incident; and two, for reproducing the environment easily when needed. Storing these logs in a centralized organizational log store allows the organization to generate useful insights and identify anomalies in the build process faster.

## Audit

Verify that the build environment is logged and stored in a centralized organizational log store.

## Remediation

Keep logs of the build environment. For example, use the .buildinfo file for Debian build workers. Also, store the logs in a centralized organizational log store.
