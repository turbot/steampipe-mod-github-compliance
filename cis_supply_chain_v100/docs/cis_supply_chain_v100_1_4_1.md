## Description

Ensure an administrator approval is required when installing applications.

## Rationale

Applications are typically automated integrations that improve the workflow of an organization. They are written by third-party developers and therefore should be validated before using in case they are malicious or cannot be trusted. Because administrators are expected to be the most qualified and trusted members of the organization, they should review the applications being installed and decide whether they are both trusted and necessary.

*Note* Applications will not be installed without administrator approval.

## Audit

Verify that applications are installed only after receiving administrator approval.

## Remediation

Require administrator approval for every installed application.
