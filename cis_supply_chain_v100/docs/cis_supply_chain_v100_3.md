## Overview

This section consists of security recommendations for the management of various dependencies introduced as part of the software build and release process. These are comprised of anything that goes into application code or is used by build pipelines themselves. 

Dependencies are a huge part of the software supply chain, as they are integrated in a lot of important phases. They are often written by third-party developers and might be vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the "log4j" attack. Because of that it is particularly important to secure them and their use in the supply chain.
