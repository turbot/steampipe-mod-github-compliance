## Description

Do not use default passwords of deployment tools and components.

## Rationale

Many deployment tools and components are provided with default passwords for the first login. This password is intended to be used only on the first login and should be changed immediately after. Using the default password increases the attack risk. It is very important to ensure that default passwords are not used in deployment tools and components.

## Audit

For each deployment tool, ensure the password is not the default one.

## Remediation

For each deployment tool, change the password.
