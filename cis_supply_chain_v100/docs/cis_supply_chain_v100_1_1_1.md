## Description

Manage all code projects in a version control platform.

## Rationale

Version control platforms keep track of every modification to code. They represent the cornerstone of code security, as well as allow for better code collaboration within engineering teams. With granular access management, change tracking, and key signing of code edits, version control platforms are the first step in securing the software supply chain.

## Audit

Ensure that all code activity is managed through a version control platform for every microservice or application developed by an organization.

## Remediation

Upload existing code projects to a dedicated version control platform and create an identity for each active team member who might contribute or need access to it.
