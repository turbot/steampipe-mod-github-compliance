## Description

Minimize the ability to upload artifacts to the lowest number of trusted users possible.

## Rationale

Artifacts might contain sensitive data. Even the simplest mistake can also lead to trust issues with customers and harm the integrity of the product. To decrease these risks, allow only trusted and qualified users to upload new artifacts. Those users are less likely to make mistakes. Having the lowest number of such users possible will also decrease the risk of hacked user accounts, which could lead to a massive breach or artifact compromise

## Audit

Ensure only trusted and qualified users can upload new artifacts, and that their number is the lowest possible.

## Remediation

Allow only trusted and qualified users to upload new artifacts, and limit them in number.
