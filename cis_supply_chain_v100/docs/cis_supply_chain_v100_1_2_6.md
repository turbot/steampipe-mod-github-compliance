## Description

Ensure every change in visibility of projects is tracked.

## Rationale

Visibility of projects determines who can access a project and/or fork it: anyone, designated users, or only members of the organization. If a private project becomes public, this may point to a potential attack, which can ultimately lead to data loss, the leaking of sensitive information, and finally to a supply chain attack. It is crucial to track these changes in order to prevent such incidents.

## Audit

Ensure that every change in project visibility is tracked and investigated.

## Remediation

Track every change in project visibility and investigate if suspicious behavior occurs.
