## Description

Ensure inactive repositories are reviewed and archived periodically

## Rationale

Inactive repositories (i.e., no new changes introduced for a long period of time) can enlarge the surface of a potential attack or data leak. These repositories are more likely to be improperly managed, and thus could possibly be accessed by many users in an organization.

**Note** Bug fixes and deployment of necessary changes could prove complicated for archived repositories.

## Audit

Verify that all the repositories in the organization are active, and those that are not are reviewed or archived.

## Remediation

Review all inactive repositories and archive them periodically.
