## Description

A SECURITY.md file is a security policy file that offers instruction on reporting security vulnerabilities in a project. When someone creates an issue within a specific project, a link to the SECURITY.md file will subsequently be shown.

## Rationale

A SECURITY.md file provides users with crucial security information. It can also serve an important role in project maintenance, encouraging users to think ahead about how to properly handle potential security issues, updates, and general security practices.

## Audit

For each repository in use, verify that it has a SECURITY.md file in the documents or root directory of the repository.

## Remediation

For each repository in use, create a SECURITY.md file and save it in the documents or root directory of the repository.
