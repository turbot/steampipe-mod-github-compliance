## Description

Ensure the organization has a minimum number of administrators.

## Rationale

Organization administrators have the highest level of permissions, including the ability to add/remove collaborators, create or delete repositories, change branch protection policy, and convert to a publicly accessible repository. Due to the permissive access granted to an organization administrator, it is highly recommended to keep the number of administrator accounts as minimal as possible.
