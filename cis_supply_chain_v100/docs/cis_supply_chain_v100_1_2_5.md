## Description

Track every fork of code and ensure it is accounted for.

## Rationale

A fork is a copy of a repository. On top of being a plain copy, any updates to the original repository itself can be pulled and reflected by the fork under certain conditions. A large number of repository copies (forks) become difficult to manage and properly secure. New and sensitive changes can often be pushed into a critical repository without developer knowledge of an updated copy of the very same repository. If there is no limit on doing this, then it is recommended to track and delete copies of organization repositories as needed.

*Note* Disabling forks completely may slow down the development process as more actions will be necessary to take in order to fork a repository.

## Audit

Verify that forks are tracked and examined regularly.

## Remediation

Track forks and examine them regularly.
