## Description

Confirm the domains an organization owns with a "Verified" badge.

## Rationale

Verifying the organizationâ€™s domains gives developers assurance that a given domain is truly the official home for a public organization. Attackers can pretend to be an organization and steal information via a faked/spoofed domain; therefore, the use of a "Verified" badge instills more confidence and trust between developers and the open-source community.

## Audit

Ensure the organization has a "Verified" badge next to its name.

## Remediation

Verify the organization's domains and secure a "Verified" badge next to its name.
