## Description

An SBOM is a file that specifies each component of software or a build process. When using a dependency, demand its SBOM and ensure it is signed for validation purposes.

## Rationale

An SBOM creates trust between its provider and its users by ensuring that the software supplied is the software described, without any potential interference in between. Signing an SBOM creates a checksum for it, which will change if the SBOMâ€™s content was changed. With that checksum, a software user can be certain nothing had happened to it during the supply chain, engendering trust in the software. When there is no such trust in the software, the risk surface is increased because one cannot know if the software is potentially vulnerable. Demanding a signed SBOM and validating it decreases that risk.

## Audit

For every artifact supplied, ensure it has a validated, signed SBOM.

## Remediation

For every artifact supplied, require, and verify a signed SBOM from its supplier.
