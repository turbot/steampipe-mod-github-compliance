## Description

Use a clean instance of build worker for every pipeline run.

## Rationale

Using a clean instance of build worker for every pipeline run eliminates the risks of data theft, data integrity breaches, and unavailability. It limits the pipelineâ€™s access to data stored on the file system from previous runs, and the cache is volatile. This prevents malicious changes from affecting other pipelines or the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system itself.

*Note* Data and cache will not be saved in different pipeline runs.

## Audit

Ensure that every pipeline that is being run has its own clean, new runner.

## Remediation

Create a clean build worker for every pipeline that is being run, or use build platform-hosted runners, as they typically offer a clean instance for every run.
