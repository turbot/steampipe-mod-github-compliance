## Description

Ensure stale (inactive) applications are reviewed and removed if no longer in use.

## Rationale

Applications that have been inactive for a long period of time are enlarging the surface of attack for data leaks. They are more likely to be improperly managed, and could possibly be accessed by third-party developers as a tool for collecting internal data of the organization or repository in which they are installed. It is important to remove these inactive applications as soon as possible.

## Audit

Verify that all the applications in the organization are actively used, and remove those that are no longer in use.

## Remediation

Review all stale applications and periodically remove them.
